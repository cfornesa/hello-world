About Chris Fornesa

My name is Chris Fornesa and I am a Mobile Data SME and an MS in Data Science candidate at Boston University's Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences Online MDS Program.

I enjoy watching history and culture deep-dives on YouTube, making art, conducting research on an assortment of topics, and keeping up with the news.  I also have a miniature poodle, named Cookie.  I am passionate about transforming the world through awareness of the issues facing marginalized and minoritized populations, which can only be had with true data availability, integrity, and literacy.

EDIT: This is a test edit to see if I can commit changes to my live "Hello World" repository on GitHub.
